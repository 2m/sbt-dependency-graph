This is a major release which brings a few breaking changes.

New features:
 - (experimental) open dependency graph directly in the browser with `dependencyBrowseGraph` ([#24](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/24))

Other changes:
 - sbt >= 0.13.8 is now required
 - this plugin is now an auto-plugin and it is automatically enabled ([#51](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/51))
 - a new backend was implemented which accesses the in-memory dependency data structures of sbt directly. The plugin doesn't
   require accessing the ivy report XML any more (the old backend can still be wired in for comparisons if needed) which
   should have solved the race condition and the dreaded `FileNotFoundException` ([#39](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/39))
   in multi-module projects.
 - code was restructured which touched a lot of the classes but didn't change the function or syntax of settings and tasks.
 - [fixed #77](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/77)
