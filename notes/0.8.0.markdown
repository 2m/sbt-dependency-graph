sbt-dependency-graph is finally an AutoPlugin and can now show the dependency graph in the browser directly.

## New features

 - (experimental) open dependency graph directly in the browser with `dependencyBrowseGraph` ([#29](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/29))

 - this plugin is finally an sbt AutoPlugin and it is automatically enabled
   ([#51](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/51))

**Note: To update from 0.7.x remove the `net.virtualvoid.sbt.graph.Plugin.graphSettings` line from your configurations.**

## Other changes

 - a new backend was implemented which accesses the in-memory dependency data structures of sbt directly. The plugin doesn't
   require accessing the ivy report XML any more (the old backend can still be wired in for comparisons if needed) which
   should have solved the race condition and the dreaded `FileNotFoundException` ([#39](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/39))
   in multi-module projects. The new backend is only used for sbt >= 0.13.6.
 - code was restructured which touched a lot of the classes but didn't change the function or syntax of settings and tasks.
 - fixed [#77](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/77)
