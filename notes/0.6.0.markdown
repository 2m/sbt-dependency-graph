New features in this version:

  * `dependency-graph` task now prints the dependency graph to the console
    (contributed by @gseitz)
  * `dependency-graph-ml` contains now the old functionality of `dependency-graph`
    which generates a `.graphml` file. Nodes now contain the dependency version as well (contributed by @gseitz).
  * The output filename of `dependency-graph-ml` has been changed to include the configuration name. It is now
    configurable using the `dependency-graph-ml-file` setting.
  * The common `scalaVersion in update` idiom to support Scala 2.9.1 libraries in a
    Scala 2.9.2 broke the plugin in 0.5.2, because it wouldn't find the ivy report xml file
    any more. This was fixed.
  * All tasks are scoped by configuration.
