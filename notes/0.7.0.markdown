New features in this version:

  * `dependency-graph` now renders a real graph. Thanks go to [Matt Russell](https://github.com/mdr/) for
    this added awesomeness.
  * The tree output from previous versions is now available with `dependency-tree`.
  * New task `what-depends-on` showing reverse dependency tree for a selected module (incl. tab-completion for modules)
  * Don't fail in cases of a missing dependency. Show errors directly in the output.
  * Show info about evicted versions.
  * By default, exclude scala-library dependency and append `[S]` to the artifact name instead. Set
    `filter-scala-library` to `false` to disable this feature.
  * Works with sbt 0.12.1. The ivy report files were moved to a new location making an update necessary.
