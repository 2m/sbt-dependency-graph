This is a maintenance release fixing a regression in 0.8.0 and adding two small features.

All changes:

 * [#84](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/84): Fix regression of DOT label rendering introduced in 0.8.0.
 * [#83](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/83): Added new task `dependencyStats` which prints a
   simple table of jar sizes for all your dependencies. Handy if you want to know why your assembled jar gets so big.
 * [#85](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph/issues/85): Added new task `dependencyList` which prints a
   flat, deduplicated list of all the transitive dependencies.
